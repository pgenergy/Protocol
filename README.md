# Sensors

This repository contains the data / code for the at the moment direct from us tested and useable sensors.  
Also needed code for creating own sensors and to push the data in the right protocol to the service is included.  

The structure is the following:
For our direct useable sensors:  
<code>data source (gas, electricity, water) -> access (analog, digital)</code>  
or for the used protocol:  
<code>protocol -> proto</code>
